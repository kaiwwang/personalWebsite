### First intern as developer

During my summer internship with the StarDust team at the University of Glasgow, I worked on a groundbreaking project involving Pat, the first programming language to implement mailbox type checking. The project entailed designing a "mailboxer" to convert Erlang code into Pat for type checking and then convert it back.

My responsibilities included identifying and resolving bugs within the "mailboxer" and enhancing Pat's error reporting system by adding precise error position and source code display features.

This role demanded substantial modifications to the lexer, parser, and type checker, presenting a significant challenge.
